Vision:

To empower students with Microsoft technologies, enabling them to learn, build, and grow into confident professionals through real-world skills and global opportunities.


Mission:


ArcShift’s mission is to bridge the gap between students and the Microsoft ecosystem by enabling access to learning, certifications, projects, cohorts, and global recognition opportunities.


Our Story:

ArcShift was started with a simple idea:
students should not just learn about technology, but learn using real industry platforms.

We noticed that many students were unaware of the opportunities available through Microsoft-free learning resources, certifications, global programs, cohorts, and recognition that can significantly strengthen their skills and resumes. ArcShift was created to bridge this gap.

Backed by a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and guided by faculty, ArcShift serves as a platform where students explore Microsoft technologies, work on real projects, challenge themselves through cohorts, and grow step by step in their technical and professional journey.


What We Do:

At ArcShift, we focus on learning, practice, and opportunity.
Introduce students to Microsoft Learn and structured learning paths
Help students prepare for Microsoft certifications and skill badges
Encourage participation in Microsoft cohorts, challenges, and programs
Build hands-on projects using Microsoft tools and platforms
